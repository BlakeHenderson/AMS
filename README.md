<strong><h1>ARTIST & BOOKING MANAGEMENT SYSTEM</strong></h1><br/>

<strong>I. Summary</strong><br/><br/>
In the music industry, it is a constant process of booking and paying artists. Nightclubs, concert halls, and large venues all must maintain a strict schedule of payments and bookings. In order to do this, one must first contact the artists booking agent, negotiate a price over a long email chain, send contracts, press photos, have flyers approved, etc. This can become overwhelming for small venues and starting bars/clubs. To simplify this process, our idea is to place everything mentioned above into one place. Users would be able to sign up and then go through a verification process asking for email, phone number and other primary contact information. They would have access to a number of artists that are a part of the website, both big and small, including all of the relevant things that a booking manager would need. This would allow for quick and easy communication between the venue and artist and put everything into one secure place. The venues would have access to a sleek and modern dashboard displaying a calendar, recent updates from artists (including prices), messages/emails from different booking agents, and much more. This management system would change the way that artists are booked and help the overall speed of the booking process. 

<strong>II.	Needs/Problems</strong><br/><br/>
As a venue, club, or festival organizer, it is difficult to manage multiple contacts and management agencies when trying to book an artist for a show. The typical way an artist is booked is through multiple email threads and communication through text message. It becomes increasingly stressful when more than a few artists are booked for a show. Payment negotiations, hotel accommodations, tour riders, all need to be satisfied as well for each individual artist. These problems have been around for a very long time, and there is no solution for the problem as of now. It would make the life of both parties easier, as it would speed up booking time significantly.   

<strong>III.	Goals/Objectives</strong><br/><br/>
Our goal is to make it easy and efficient to book artists around the world. Below are some of the features that we would like to implement into the application<br/>
•	A simple and seamless artist search system with the ability to filter based on price, genre, etc.<br/>
•	A profile for each artist including booking price, tour rider, location, dates of availability, contact options, bio, press photos, etc.<br/>
•	Contract submission for artists and venues with electronic signature<br/>
•	The ability to connect with the artist through simple in-app communication for negotiations<br/>
•	Allow for anyone with an account to book certain artists, must be verified with email address<br/>
•	For venues, festivals, and concerts, managers will have one simple dashboard with everything necessary for planning including a to-do list, calendar, payment options, etc.<br/>
•	Artists will have the ability to be paid directly through the app with either e-check or wire-transfer<br/>

<strong>IV.	Evaluation</strong><br/><br/>
Throughout the project, bi-weekly assessments will be submitted including clear indicators on progress for the objectives and goals we set above. Based on the schedule that is provided to us, we will be able to effectively and thoroughly maintain strict progress guidelines. I, Blake Henderson will be submitting these reports on Sep 11, Sep 25, Oct 9, Oct 23, Nov 6, Nov 20, and Dec 4. These reports will be based on the template given to us.
